### By Nana Amina Abubakar
This project was done using Data analysis techniques. In november 2021, it was announced during the budget reading that there would be an introduction of taxes on electronic money tranfers. This took effect in May 2022 after several struggles to pass it in parliament. Ghanaians home and abroad shared thier thoughts across social media platforms including twitter were my project was centered on. The libraries i used for this project include:
1. Pandas - for Data Cleaning/Manipulation
2. Geophy - for Tweets mining
3. PowerBi - for data vizualization
